## 🎬 OPENING (2 minutes)

**YOU:** Good morning, everyone!

_[Pause, smile]_

I have a confession to make. Last week, I got a physics assignment. The question was: _"Derive the formula for gravitational potential energy."_

_[Click - slide shows the question]_

Now, what do you think I did?

_[Pause for audience reaction]_

I did what **most of us** do. I opened ChatGPT...

_[Click - show ChatGPT interface]_

...typed in the question with barely any thought...

_[Click - show sloppy prompt: "derive gravity pls"]_

...and hit enter.

_[Click - ChatGPT response fills screen]_

**Look at this.**

_[Pause, let audience read]_

It gave me the **complete answer**. The entire derivation. Step by step. Ready to copy-paste into my homework.

---

**[Tone shifts - more serious]**

Here's the problem...

_[Click - highlight the complete answer]_

This isn't education. This is **outsourcing our thinking**.

Look what happened:

- ❌ I didn't engage my brain
- ❌ I didn't understand the concept
- ❌ I just... copied
- ❌ My creativity? **Gone.**
- ❌ My problem-solving skills? **Deteriorating.**

_[Click - statistics slide]_

And this isn't a small issue. Research shows that over-reliance on direct AI answers:

- Reduces critical thinking by **40%**
- Decreases creative problem-solving abilities
- Leaves students **unprepared for real-world challenges**

_[Pause, let it sink in]_

---

\*_[Click - news headlines slide: "Schools Ban ChatGPT"]_

So what did institutions do? They **BANNED** AI.

_[Shake head]_

But history has taught us something important: **Prohibition doesn't work.**

**The solution isn't to ban AI...**

_[Dramatic pause]_

**...it's to make AI that actually helps us LEARN.**

## 🚀 THE BIG REVEAL (1 minute)

**[Click - Lyra logo animates onto screen]**

**Today, we're introducing Lyra.**

_[Let logo settle]_

**An ethical AI tutor—built FOR students, designed BY educators, and customisable BY teachers.**

_[Click - tagline appears]_

**"AI That Guides, Not Tells"**

---

**[Gesture to screen]**

Lyra is built on the **same powerful AI** as ChatGPT—we're not losing any capabilities instead we are gaining. But we've done something revolutionary:

_[Click - visual: AI with "pedagogical guardrails" around it]_

We've wrapped it in what we call **"Pedagogical Guardrails"**—invisible rules that ensure AI acts like a **real teacher**, not a homework machine.

---

**And here's the exciting part—**

_[Big smile]_

**You can try it RIGHT NOW.**

_[Click - Large QR code with instructions]_

📱 **Scan this QR code**
🌐 Visit **Lyra.edu.vercel.app**
⚡ **Install the PWA** (it takes 10 seconds)

_[Give audience 30 seconds to scan and install]_

Go ahead, pull out your phones. We're going to do this **together**.

_[Walk around, encourage people]_

## 🎯 LIVE DEMO - The Magic Moment (3 minutes)

**[Return to center stage. Open Lyra on your device, projected on screen]**

Alright! Let's see the **real difference**.

Remember that physics question? Let me ask Lyra the **exact same thing**.

_[Type into Lyra: "Derive the formula for gravitational potential energy"]_

_[Click Send]_

**Watch what happens...**

---

**[Lyra's response appears slowly]**

```
"Great question! Before we dive into the derivation,
let me ask you something:

What do you already know about gravitational force?
Can you describe what happens to an object's
potential energy as it moves further from Earth?"
```

_[Pause, look at audience]_

**Did you see that?**

Lyra didn't give me the answer. It asked me a **question back**.

Just like a **real teacher** would do if you approached them in the hallway.

---

_[Continue the conversation on screen, showing 2-3 exchanges]_

**ME:** _"I know gravity pulls objects down, and potential energy increases with height..."_

**LYRA:** _"Excellent! You're on the right track. Now, if we lift an object of mass 'm' by a small height 'dh', what force are we working against?"_

**ME:** _"The gravitational force... mg?"_

**LYRA:** _"Perfect! And if the work done is F × d, can you write an expression for the small amount of work done?"_

---

_[Turn to audience]_

**Look at what just happened!**

- ✅ I'm **thinking**
- ✅ I'm **engaged**
- ✅ I'm **building understanding**
- ✅ I'm using **my own words**

_[Click - show final answer I derived myself]_

And after 2-3 exchanges, **I got to the answer myself.**

---

**[Click - Split screen: ChatGPT vs Lyra approach]**

**This is what we call _verbalization_.**

_[Personal story tone]_

Whenever I had doubts growing up, I wouldn't just tell me the answer. I'd **explain my thinking out loud** to my father.

And you know what? Often, while I was explaining, the proverbial lightbulb would go off. **I'd solve it myself.**

_[Click - terms appear on screen]_

This technique has names in education:

- 🦆 **Rubber Duck Debugging** (programmers do this)
- 🧠 **Feynman Technique** (Nobel Prize winner's method)
- 💡 **Socratic Method** (Ancient Greece, still works today)

**Lyra is doing exactly this—making you verbalize, making you think.**

## 🎨 CUSTOMIZATION - The Teacher's Superpower (3 minutes)

But wait—there's another problem with AI tools today.

_[Personal anecdote]_

I remember last semester, I asked ChatGPT for help with a math problem. It gave me a solution using a technique we **hadn't learned yet** in class. My teacher looked at my homework and immediately knew I'd used AI.

Why? Because **ChatGPT doesn't know my school's curriculum**.

---

**This is where RAG comes in.**

Imagine if the AI had access to a **custom database**—your textbooks, your teacher's notes, your school's syllabus, even the **NEW EDUCATION POLICY**.

_[Click - visual: AI connected to school materials]_

That's what Lyra does.

---

**[Demo on screen]**

Let me show you how a teacher uses this.

_[Switch to Teacher Dashboard]_

**This is the Teacher Dashboard.**

**Step 1:** Teacher selects their subject—let's say **Mathematics for Class 10**.
**Step 2:** They write their teaching philosophy:
**Step 3:** They add example responses:
❌ **Bad Response:** "The answer is x = 5"
✅ **Good Response:** "What method did we learn to solve this? Can you identify the coefficients a, b, and c first?"
**Step 4:** They upload course materials:

- 📄 Chapter 5 Notes.pdf
- 📊 CBSE Syllabus 2024.pdf
- 📝 Practice Problems.docx

---

**And just like that—the AI becomes _their_ teaching assistant.**

slide {_[Click - before/after comparison]_

slide **Before customization:**
Generic AI → Uses random methods → Doesn't match curriculum

slide **After customization:**
Lyra → Follows YOUR syllabus → Speaks in YOUR teaching style}

---

**[More excited tone]**

**But it gets even better!**

_[Click - Individual student customization]_

Every student learns differently, right?

- Some students need **deeper conceptual explanations**
- Some need **more visual examples**
- Some students with **learning disabilities** need specialized approaches

---

**[Passionate closing of this section]**

This is **DIFFERENTIATED LEARNING** at scale.

Something every teacher **wants** to do but physically **can't**—because they have 40 students in a class.

**Lyra gives every student a personalized tutor.**

But that tutor follows **your curriculum**, speaks in **your voice**, and supports **your teaching style**.

_[Pause for impact]_

---

### 2. **Few-Shot Prompting** 🎓

_[Show example]_

We give the AI **curated examples** of good teaching:

```
❌ "The answer is 42"
✅ "What operation should we try first?"
```

The AI **learns by example** to respond like a tutor, not a calculator.

---

### 3. **RAG - Retrieval-Augmented Generation** 🔍

_[Show simplified diagram]_

**Translation:** The AI doesn't just **guess** from its training.

It **searches** your school's uploaded materials **in real-time** and bases answers on **your curriculum**.

**Benefits:**

- ✅ **Fewer hallucinations** (made-up answers)
- ✅ **Curriculum-aligned** responses
- ✅ **Affordable customization** (no expensive retraining)

---

### 4. **Vector Databases** 🧮

_[Show visual: words transforming into vectors]_

**Quick explainer:**

Instead of storing text as... text, we store it as **semantic embeddings**.

_[Show two similar sentences with close vectors]_

"Derive gravitational force" → **[0.2, 0.8, 0.5, ...]**
"Explain gravity formula" → **[0.19, 0.82, 0.48, ...]**

The AI understands **meaning**, not just keywords.

Result: **Smarter, more relevant answers.**
